DeepZoomViewer TODO
Author: Don Liang (dl2k84@gmail.com)

- Write comments for private methods (currently only public methods and interfaces have comments).
- Write more documentation describing how to use the UI.
- Remove redundant code, optimize repetitive method operations.
- Refactor the project to separate projects so the
  DeepZoom image fetching API and the Viewer UI do not rely on each other.
- Implement a C# runtime UI using WPF or WinForms.
- Fix the scaling and zooming defect for the thumbnail tile (setting is off)
- Fix the zooming algorithm (is not reliable after the first level)
- Implement an image drawing queue (currently uses a rudimentary method)
- Get rid of the Viewer.properties config file and have it managed in a UI.
- Improved error logging
- Smarter tile fetching algorithm with priority queues when multiple images
  exist in a collection and the viewed image changes.
- Improve the UI graphical effects for image scrolling ala Silverlight/iOS/Android.
- Add support for local file system reading of DeepZoom collections, as well
  as those stored in XAP and DZI files.
- Implement a smarter image quality control algorithm (lossy/lossless option).
- Unit tests.

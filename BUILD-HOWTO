DeepZoomViewer v0.1
Author: Don Liang (dl2k84@gmail.com)

The following is detailed information on how to get this project built
(for those without a Scala development environment set up):

What you need to build this project:
- Scala 2.9 distribution

 An IDE capable of understanding and compiling Scala code such as Eclipse or
 IntelliJ IDEA with the Scala plugin installed is recommended to help build
 and run this project.

What you need to run this project:
- Java JDK or JRE 1.5 and higher

 As the UI and graphics drawing code draws exclusively from the Java2D and
 Scala-wrapped Swing APIs of the Java programming language, you will need
 to have the JRE 1.5 or JDK 1.5 runtime installed on your computer in order
 to run this application. The Java runtime libraries are freely available
 on Oracle's web site.

 Eventually, a C# version of this application's UI will be developed using
 WinForms or WPF but until then this application will only support the
 execution on Java's JVM.

How to run this application:
 1. In the directory with the outputted Java binaries, open the
 Viewer.properties file and edit the first setting called
 "baseUrl" to the HTTP or HTTPS URL where the base
 DeepZoom descriptor is located.

 2. Run liang.don.dzviewer.DeepZoomViewerMain through java or javaw
    including related Scala APIs with the classpath argument
    e.g. java [Scala classpath here] liang.don.dzviewer.DeepZoomViewerMain
    Alternatively, build a jar specifying the above class as the main class.

 N.B. If the project was not built with the help of an IDE,
      the Viewer.properties file may be missing. You can find
      it located at the base directory of this project.

Miscellaneous:
 This project was written with the help of the IntelliJ IDEA IDE with the
 Scala plugin installed so the project code should load in that IDE
 without problems. The reason I chose this IDE is because it coped the
 best with my development machine.

- Zooming into a DeepZoom image either by clicking the "Zoom In" button
  or double-clicking on a region is not reliable nor accurate after
  the first zoom level.
- Bug (race condition) in the DeepZoom tile drawing method whereby the
  image is drawn before certain tiles finish downloading or loading
  from the local cache resulting in black areas.
- The Viewer UI will freeze up if the given baseUrl descriptor
  contains a large image collection (10+).
- Crashes when a MultiScaleImage subImage URL is passed to
  Viewer.properties as the baseURL.

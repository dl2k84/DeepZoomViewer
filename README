DeepZoomViewer v0.1
Author: Don Liang (dl2k84@gmail.com)

This is a program written in Scala programming language
to view images that conform to Microsoft's Deep Zoom image format
which is part of the Silverlight framework.
See: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc645050%28v=vs.95%29.aspx

If you have a Scala development environment set up with Java runtime support,
the application can be started by invoking the main class:
liang.don.dzviewer.DeepZoomViewerMain

Alternatively, build a jar specifying the above class as the main class.

Otherwise please refer to the BUILD-HOWTO file on how to get this
project built and running.

v0.1 is an initial publish so there is no doubt redundant and inefficient code.
This will be optimized and refactored in future revisions.

Currently the viewer UI is written with the Java Swing library.
A future revision will add a C# UI using WPF or WinForms
so it can run in the C# CLR virtual machine.
